# Knights Travails

by HÃ©ctor Gonzalez Orozco

Built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

This app displays the shortest possible path between two squares in chess using a knight.

It calculates it by doing a breadth-first search on a graph. Every vertex represents a single square, with edges joining them if a direct move is possible between them. The algorithm recursively adds each vertex neighbors to a queue and looks for the first instance of the end vertex.
